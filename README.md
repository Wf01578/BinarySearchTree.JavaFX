# BinarySearchTree.JavaFX
My Implementation of a BST GUI, you can add/remove nodes, as well as finding the Inorder, Preorder and PostOrder of the nodes in the tree.
To use this program, be sure you've got the JavaFX libraries installed with your IDE otherwise you will see loads of errors. Usage is pretty 
straight-forward, all of the buttons and functions are fairly self-explanatory in the GUI.
